               Escapism is the longing for a life that isn't the life you are living. Escapism has become a topic that pops up more and more with the advent of advanced gaming and virtual technologies. With this, escapism is becoming a more present theme in our lives as we progress technologically. Escapism before the days of video games and artificial intelligence, was usually attributed to the longing for the life in one's dreams and not willing to address reality. My question is: how are we supposed to address the growing collective longing for a different life, separate from the one we are living? I think that with every passing year tow main factors play into a growing collective escapist mindset. One, the looming issues of climate change and the ever-present reminder that man-kinds existence on this earth is numbered. Also the threat of global catastrophe and pandemic every year, especially post COVID-19. Two, the advances in technology and artifical intelligence are helping people create lives outside of their reality. I predict that within 25 years, there will be very realistic and life-like experiences or maybe entire lives being conducted entirely within a virtual reality. These two main factors contribute to the growing societal urge to escape reality and restart or live an alternate life somewhere else. I personally can relate to the mentality, and I think that this is something that should be addressed by the sociological and psychological fields in the future, if not now. When will human-life be replaced by humans living other lives somewhere else.
