               Another round of investigation into my aesthetic and design preferences. This time we will be looking into Alvar Aalto, my personal favorite architect. I think that Alvar Aalto's approach to architecture and design partically capture my own approach to design. Aalto, when he was a child, would continuously draw a hand form with finger-like appendages. This form would find it's way into many of his later designs, from a vase to a building. This persistence and loyalty to a form is something I can relate to, I continuously draw the same thing, in different varioations, over and over again. I think that Aalto's mix of vernalcular Finnish design and materiality along with his modern tnedencies, create an architecture that I find very human. His designs are very interesting both in plan and in section. He also has immense attention to detail and created many impeccable gesamtkunstwerks throughout his career.He would design all of the furniture for his residential and non-residential buildings. He would even go to the lengths of creating interior layouts for each piece of furniture. The way Aalto combines organic form into the architecture and can seamlessly blend the physical with the natural, is special and I especially appreciate its almost critical regionalist approach. Next week we will be looking at a specific piece of architecture, that i find interesting and comes from a part of the world, that you may not think of when it comes to architecture.
