            <p>The world is changing with an exponential pace. So are the wars we fight. These wars have become
                something we
                fight from afar. The paper written by Scott Fitzsimmons and Karina Sangha explore the ability of the
                United
                States Air Force to disguise human targets as non-human forms in order to safeguard drone pilots from
                potential
                trauma. What are the boundaries on what we do to gamify and dehumanize these victims? Should this be
                something
                that modern day war-time rules oversee? I believe that if the United States and other world
                powers
                continue down this path (if they are going down this path) it may lead to highly controversial and
                ethically
                precarious foreign policy and war-time decisions. The United States' stance on foreign policy has been
                under
                a
                lot of scrutiny throughout the 21st century, and these diplomatic conundrums of fighting for democracy
                while
                risking countless civilian lives hangs in the balance everyday. If the United States becomes so detached
                from
                the wars they engage in, what will be stopping the US Military from carrying out even more highly
                immoral
                missions in the future? To finish, I believe that the desktopization of war may not be the reality nor
                the
                future, but it does cast a dark shadow on what the United States seems to deem ethical and righteous
                when
                it
                comes to fighting wars in countries thousands of miles away.
