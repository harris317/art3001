            <p>
                I think in the modern day America, the idea of meritocracy and everything that goes with it should be
                questioned. Whether it be the ability to gain social status or economic class through only hard work and
                the
                quality of one's effort. I don't think it is possible for people to get to their desired social class
                and
                societal output without being privileged. The sheer amount of inequalities and injustices that occur in
                the
                United States of America do nothing but make it nearly impossible for certain groups to take advantage
                or
                even
                feel the effects of meritocracy. I would argue that the idea of meritocracy might only apply to the
                people
                who
                have experienced social ascension, purely because these people achieved that through privilege not pure
                meritocracy. I do know that many people do manage to rise through the social and economic ranks through
                hardwork
                and perserverance, but this simply is not a universal truth. Meritocracy, as described in the United
                States,
                postulates that everyone, meaning quite literally everyone, can achieve their goals through pure hard
                work
                and
                effort. This is not the case. The cognitive dissonance that exists when it comes to believing in
                meritocracy
                is astonishing. Many people, usually privileged white people, say that meritocracy exists while they
                participate in
                racist, discriminatory behaviors hindering the ability of others to live in a meritocracy. This leads
                to
                the
                idea of moral capitalism and if it is even possible for this to exist in the United States or anywhere. If moral
                capitalism and meritocracy were to exist, then large corporations wouldn't be able to participate in
                exploitive
                labor practices and people would have to be paid fair wages in all lines of work, housing prices and
                wages
                would
                have to equal to each other, companies would have to never profit off of minorities or racist practices,
                and
                they would have to be environmentally conscious. But even if all of these thing were true, meritocracy
                still
                wouldn't exist in a true form due to other things like University cost and admissions practices, person
                to
                person
                discrimination, and other factors. This is why I believe American Meritocracy shouldn't be an idea on which we
                base
                our  national image and policies, and Americans should work hard to reverse the current course in order
                to
                actually achieve the American ideal.
