               The next few blog entires will be exploring what I enjoy in design and architecture and where my specific tastes stem from and attempting to put into words what I find aethetically pleasing and architecturally interesting. The Catalan vualt is one of my favirotue architectural details that has developed over the history of architecture. It is quite common to find a Cataln Vault, not inly in Catalonia, but in a lot of Mediterranean architecture. The origin of the Catalan vault orginally became widespread in modern-day Catalonia through architects like Antoní Gaudí and Rafael Gustavino. It was developed originally was developed during the Roman era and became most popular in Catalonia, but wasn't a strictly Catalan invention as it was used around the Roman Empire. Around 1904, the term "Catalan vault" was first used at an architectural congressin Madrid, Spain. The earliest known written reference of the Catalan vault was back in 1382 from Valencia, Spain. Early variations of the Catalan vault were in Catalonia, Valencia, and Mallorca. What I like about the Catalan vault, is that it creates a simple yet detailed ceiling without the use of excessive ornamentation. It creates a sense of space which I think is unique to the Catalan vault. i also think that the feeling twhich one has when you occupy this space is unique. i like the slightly unfinished or rough finish that most Catalan vaults have, there is something about architectural, deisgn, and fashion aspects that I enjoy that share this slightly unkempt look, unkepmt but purposeful. A word that I found that described this effortless, unkempt, yet purposeful look is the word sprezzatura. Sprezzatura is an italian word that descirbes the fashion of people who achieve an effortless style as if they thre it togehter in a matter of minutes yet is very purposeful. I think this effect can be achieved in a lot of design fields but is harder to create in architecture as modern architecture stresses a clean and finished look. I will discuss this further next week when I speak about vernacular architecture and critical regionalism. I will also cite some of my favorite houses designed by architects and artists that achieve this effortless, unkempt look while being very purposeful in their decision-making.
